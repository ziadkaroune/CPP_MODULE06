CPP Module 06 in the 42 curriculum focuses on C++ type casting, particularly in the context of polymorphism and Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI). It introduces different casting operators (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast) and teaches when to use them safely. The module helps students understand safe type conversions, memory reinterpretation, and polymorphic behavior in object-oriented programming. ðŸš€
